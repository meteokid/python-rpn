</b>

        Version 3.2.1 of the GEMDM dynamics is almost ready and available 
        in directories:
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.2.0/RCS_DYN"
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.2.0/RCS_4DVAR"
	It is connected to RPN/CMC physics version 4.3 in directory:
	      "$ARMNLIB/modeles/PHY/v_4.3/RCS:4.3"

MAIN FEATURES:
</b>

  There has been many significant changes in this version which DO seem
  to improve the performance and meteorological results. It is connected to
  Physics version 4.3 so please refer to the Physics 4.3 release 
  notes for details. Documentation on previous GEMDM releases can be
  found in:

  http://notos.cmc.ec.gc.ca/mrb/rpn/eng/gemdm/gemdm.html

  This note is available in the website under Version Rel. Date at v 3.2.1

  Please note that there are additional files at this GEMDM website (v3.2.1)

                          IMPORTANT NOTE (same as V_3.2.0)
  The source code has been divided in 2 RCS with corresponding libraries.
  The non-linear forward code is stored in $gem/RCS_DYN whereas the
  4DVAR code is stored in $gem/RCS_4DVAR. The makefile load target for
  the non-linear GEMDM is unchanged (make gemdm). An additional target
  has been added to the Makefile in order to load an executable containing
  4DVAR capabilities - make gem4d.

1) New physics package (4.3) (Leduc/Bilodeau), still under verification.

2) New optimized code for OpenMP > 4

3) Entry program e_gemntr will print a bigger warning when it fails to
   produce the file geophy.bin

4) Values for constants are obtained from RMNLIB functions

5) Lctl_reset key added to start model at Timestep other than 0

6) Memory for PHYSICS is always in core

7) Removed Tr2d tracers

8) Code for Coupling from Sophie (Schm_offline)

9) New keys to control Phy 4.3:
