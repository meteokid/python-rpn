        ############# GEMDM Model -- Version 3.1.1 ###############
                            December 4 2003
</b>

        Version 3.1.1 of the GEMDM dynamics is now ready and available 
        in directory:
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.1.1/RCS_DYN"
	It is connected to RPN/CMC physics version 4.0 in directory:
	      "$ARMNLIB/modeles/PHY/v_4.0/RCS:4.0"

MAIN FEATURES:
</b>

  This version is very similar to the previous version 3.1.0
  EXCEPT that it will NO LONGER RUN ON THE SX6 (YATA). Please
  see notes on previous releases and documentation in:

  http://riemann.cmc.ec.gc.ca/eng/gemdm/gemdm.html


  The main features of this version are:

1) Namelist changes in gem_settings.nml:
   The variables Ptopo_npex and Ptopo_npey formally in 
   namelist gem_cfgs is now in a separate namelist as follows:

   &ptopo
     Ptopo_npex = 2, Ptopo_npey = 8,
   /

   New options to run a few theoretical cases (Sylvie Gravel)
   Look in gem_settings.doc for the new options; extract by
   'omd_exp gem_settings.doc' in an opened experiment

2) IBM port of most 4D-var routines

3) Output changes which is transparent from version 3.1.0 to
   this version 3.1.1. A little note here for those interested
   in the change internally:
      Each processor now writes directly to it's own local 
      directory rather than the directory 'output'. At completion 
      of a model run, the files are moved to the directory 'output'. 
      Then a job will be submitted to itself (same machine) to 
      'delam' the raw slab data files and written out as RPN
      '#' standard files. Post-processing will be done at this
      point and a separate job is launched for actual transfer.

4) Horizontal Diffusion: Correction of openmp bugs and addition of a 
   new (faster) transpose function from RPN_COMM

5) GEM LAM: Time-series output is enabled and correction in Vspng
