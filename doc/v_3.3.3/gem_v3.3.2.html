                            Mar  10 2009
</b>

        Version 3.3.2 of the GEMDM dynamics is now ready and available 
        in directories:
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.3.2/RCS_DYN"
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.3.2/RCS_4DVAR"
	It is connected to RPN/CMC physics version 4.7 in directory:
	      "$ARMNLIB/modeles/PHY/v_4.7/RCS"    

<b> Please note the new GEMDM website is now available at:

MAIN FEATURES:
</b>
  
  This release is targeting 3 operational applications. The new regional 
  operational configuration currently running in parallel (REG_IPY), the new 
  global uniform stratospheric application (meso-strato) scheduled for operation 
  implementation later this year and the experimental coupled system with the ROM 
  model in the Gulf of St-Lawrence. 
  This note is available in the MRBDOC website under Version Rel. Date at v_3.3.2

1) COMPILER CHANGE in LINUX (Before running or compiling on LINUX!!)
   User must ask for the correct compiler by typing:

   . r.ssmuse.dot pgi6xx
  
2) New physics package (v_4.7)
   Documentation of its namelist parameters is in phy_namelist

3) New coupler interface
   The coupling interface itf_cpl*.ftn has been entirely re-designed to give more
   flexibility in choosing the mean of communication between applications as well
   as the type of mechanism to map data into different grids. The only available and stable
   option for communication is currently MPI which means that the coupled system
   runs use a MIMD approach with a single r.mpirun command. We plan to re-implement
   the communicator GOSSIP in version 4.0.4. The only grid re-mapping (gridding) option for
   the moment is an in-house approach called 'P2G_MV' which is a combination
   of ez_escint and an in-house algorithm for area averaging with a dynamical mask.

4) Clipping of Semi-Lagrangian trajectories for LAM configuration
   Clipping of the Semi-Lagrangian trajectories in LAM configurations is now
   always activated. By default, the clipping is performed only at the processor
   boundaries. Trajectories are clipped according to a user's choice of
   maximum Courrant number allowed for a particular run. The control parameter is
   the &gem_cfgs namelist variable Step_maxcfl (default = 1). Former control
   parameters Glb_pil_n and Adw_halox are no longer in the &gem_cfgs namelist
   as they are now computed from the user's specification of Step_maxcfl.
   

5) Horizontal diffusion on real winds.
   Since diffusion on wind images will often cause problems near the numerical poles
   with a large Hzd_lnr, we now apply the horizontal diffusion operator on real
   wind components. The treatment therefore becomes identical in the horizontal
   diffusion and the vertical sponge schemes.

5a) Vertical Sponge for LAM. 
    The vertical sponge is only activated if Vspng_nk > 0 and if Vspng_nutop> 0.
    If the parameter Vspng_nk is greater than zero and Vspng_nutop is undefined,
the model will stop

5b) Grid namelist (name is changed from Grille to Grid)
    One new feature to allow a description of the grid is to provide
    a file with the record of "tictacs" in a RPN standard file. (It will
    ignore the other parameters in this namelist)

6) ISST standards
   Working directory as well as input and output directories and all input files
   to the model are now following the newly implemented ISST standards. The model
   scripts (Um_*.ksh) have also been modified to reflect those new standards.
   

7) SETTLS scheme 
   Estimate upstream position at t-dt using acceleration (See Hortal et al. QJRMS, 2002)

8) New control for smt
   From an OMP ressource allocation obtained through variable BACKEND_OMP of the
   file configexp.dot.cfg given to Um_lance and somewhat pushed to the batch job,
   the user has the following 2 parameters to control the actual number of threads
   at execution time. Those parameters are the &ptopo namelist variables
   Ptopo_smtdyn and Ptopo_smtphy whose defaults are the value of $BACKEND_OMP.
   Ptopo_smtdyn controls the number of thread for the dynamics whereas Ptopo_smtphy
   controls the number of threads for the physics. Both can take values smaller
   or greater than $BACKEND_OMP. Simultaneous MultiThreading (Ptopo_smt* > $BACKEND_OMP)
   (can be called Hyper-threading) is only available on AIX.

9) Bug_fixes:
	offline
	variable topography
	e_filtopx
        LAM nesting
