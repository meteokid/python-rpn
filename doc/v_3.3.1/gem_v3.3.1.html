        Version 3.3.1 of the GEMDM dynamics is now ready and available 
        in directories:
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.3.1/RCS_DYN"
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.3.1/RCS_4DVAR"
	It is connected to RPN/CMC physics version 4.6 in directory:
	      "$ARMNLIB/modeles/PHY/v_4.6/RCS"

MAIN FEATURES:
</b>

  There have been many significant changes in this version from the
  previous version (v_3.2.2, phy v_4.4) but it does not seem to change 
  the meteorological results dramatically except maybe for LAM
  configurations since the lateral boundary specification and blending
  have evolved to meet the requirements of the acid test with full physics. 
  This version will definitely not bit reproduce results of the v_3.2.2 on
  any configuration. It is connected to Physics version 4.5 so please refer 
  to the Physics release notes for details. This release is not targeted to
  any immediate operational use. Documentation on previous GEMDM releases 
  can be found in:
