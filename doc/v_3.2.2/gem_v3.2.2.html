        ############# GEMDM Model -- Version 3.2.2 ###############
                            December 9 2005
</b>

        Version 3.2.2 of the GEMDM dynamics is now ready and available 
        in directories:
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.2.2/RCS"
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.2.2/RCS_4DVAR"
	It is connected to RPN/CMC physics version 4.4 in directory:
	      "$ARMNLIB/modeles/PHY/v_4.4/RCS"

MAIN FEATURES:
</b>

  There has been many significant changes in this version from the
  previous version of (v_3.2.0,phy v_4.2) but it does not seem to change 
  the meteorological results dramatically. It will definitely not
  bit reproduce results of the v_3.2.0. It is connected to
  Physics version 4.4 so please refer to the Physics 4.4 release 
  notes for details. This release is targeted for the mesoglobal
  operational runs. Documentation on previous GEMDM releases can be
  found in:

  http://notos.cmc.ec.gc.ca/mrb/rpn/eng/gemdm/gemdm.html

  or

  http://web-mrb.cmc.ec.gc.ca/mrb/rpn/eng/gemdm/gemdm.html

  Also note that the GEMDM Workshop PPT and PDF format is now available.

  This note is available in the website under Version Rel. Date at v_3.2.2

  Please note that there are additional files at this GEMDM website (v_3.2.2)
  which are related to this version:

  Changes that affect run time computation:
#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+

1) New physics package (v_4.4)

2) Optimization code for the 4dvar OpenMp to work 8-way (Desgagne/Valin)

4) Optimized code for output in RPN standard files (Lee)

5) Printout per timestep includes resident memory size

6) Bugfixes: 
    - Memory leak in hzd_ho for 'HO' option in MXMA config
    - memory leak in BMF functions in RPN_COMM (now using 208)

#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+
   Other Changes related to new schemes and/or packages:
#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+


1) Added Lctl_reset (default=-1) to change starting step of integration

2) Pres_vtap_L namelist key added to calculate GZ
   from temperature based on VTAP relationship. (default=.false.)

3) Code from Oasis coupling (Valcke)

4) New keys to control physics v_4.4:
   P_pbl_limsnodp_L   - to limit snow depth to 10cm on seaice and 
                        glaciers (default = .false.)
   P_pbl_schurb_s     - SCHMURB: name of urban surface processes
                        (default='NIL' and only in the GEMNTR namelist only)
   P_pbl_tdiaglim_L   - to limit on decrease of tdiag     (default = .false.)
   P_rad_tsflxir_L    - TS_IRFLX: to use TT(12000) instead of
                        skin Temp in downward IR flux calc.(Default= .false.)
   P_cond_kfctriga    - nominal resolution for which KFCTRIG4 is set
                        this is inactive if value <= 0 (default=-1.0)
   P_cond2_kfctriga (same as P_cond_kfctriga)

5) Memory for PHYSICS is always in core

6) Entry program e_gemntr will print a bigger warning when it fails to
   produce the file geophy.bin

7) Values for constants are obtained through RMNLIB functions

#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+
   Cleanup and cosmetic changes:
#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+

1) Replaced the line #include <model_macros_f.h> to 
                     #include "model_macros_f.h"

2) Removed Tr2d tracers as they have never been used

3) Removed geomg_n1.cdk and incorporated this code into geomg.cdk

#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+
   Upgrading:
#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+#+

From GEMDM v_3.2.0, code changes are in /users/dor/armn/viv/v3.2.0/newcode10/

From GEMDM v_3.2.1, code changes are in /users/dor/armn/viv/v3.2.1/newcode1/

Note  the change in almost all routines from 
<model_macros_f.h> to "model_macros_f.h"
