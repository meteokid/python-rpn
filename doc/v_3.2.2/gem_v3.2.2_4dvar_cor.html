        ############# GEMDM Model -- Version 3.2.2 4dVAR CORRECTION ####
                            January  13 2006
</b>

        Please note that a correction has been made in the current
        version 3.2.2 of the 4DVAR of GEMDM . Unfortunately, for those
        who have done tests since the original release (Dec.16,2005) with
        OpenMP greater than 1 (OMP_THREADS), results maybe incorrect. 
        Sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you.

        The routine adw_main_3_intlag_ad (advection in the adjoint only)
        gave different results depending on the number of threads used
        for the interpolation on certain fields.

        /users/dor/armn/viv/v3.2.0/newcode10/ (upgrade v_3.2.0-> v_3.2.2)
        /users/dor/armn/viv/v3.2.1/newcode1/  (upgrade v_3.2.1-> v_3.2.2)

        Thank-you.
