        ############# GEMDM Model -- Version 3.2.2 CORRECTION ####
                            January  9 2006
</b>

        Please note that a correction has been made in the current
        version 3.2.2 of GEMDM. Unfortunately, for those who have
        done tests since the original release (Dec.16,2005) with more 
        than 1 PE(cpu), results are incorrect. Sorry for the 
        inconvenience this may have caused you.

        The key "Pres_vtap_L" was not properly broadcasted to all PEs.
        Only one routine was modified with respect to the original 
        library and this is "bcastc1.ftn". Also note that this change has
        also been done in the directories for guide to version upgrade in:

        /users/dor/armn/viv/v3.2.0/newcode10/ (upgrade v_3.2.0-> v_3.2.2)
        /users/dor/armn/viv/v3.2.1/newcode1/  (upgrade v_3.2.1-> v_3.2.2)

        Thank-you.
