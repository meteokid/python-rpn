        ############# GEMDM Model -- Version 3.1.0 ###############
                               June 13 2003
</b>

        Version 3.1.0 of the GEMDM dynamics is now ready and available 
        in directory:
              "$ARMNLIB/modeles/GEMDM_shared/v_3.1.0/RCS_DYN"
	It is connected to RPN/CMC physics version 3.9 in directory:
	      "$ARMNLIB/modeles/PHY/v_3.9/RCS:3.9"

MAIN FEATURES:
</b>

  This version is strictly speaking an IBM port with some
  single PE optimizations. We have also introduced OpenMP
  capability for AIX and IRIX64 plateforms. It is therefore
  possible to use a mix of MPI and OpenMP on those two
  plateforms while only MPI is available for LInux and
  SXs plateforms. The main features of this version are:

1) Production of 2 executables instead of 1. The Makefile is now
   equipped with target 'gemntr' to produce maingemntr_${mach}_${version}.Abs
   and with target 'gemdm' to produce maingemdm_${mach}_${version}.Abs.
   The target 'gem' is still available but will now produce the 2
   executables at once. The -absaddres option of Um_launch must now
   be used to specify a directory in which the 2 executables are located.

2) Namelist variables Ptopo_npeOpenMP and Ptopo_npeMacro have been
   removed; current gem_settings.cfg files will therefore have to be adjusted.
   The number of OpenMP threads is now controlled by a new control
   key to Um_launch called -npeOMP (default=1).
   
3) In order to benefit from a graphic interface developed by arma
   people (Simon Pellerin et al.) the extensions to the current
   control files:
                  gem_settings.cfg
		  output.cfg
		  configexp.dot.cfg
   have been changed to
                  gem_settings.nml
		  output.out
		  configexp.dot.cfg
