*
*object
*       Prepare flags et weights for FCPKUO/KFCKUO options.
*       Those options allow the use of FCP (or KFC) scheme in a
*       central window and KUO outside of this central window,
*       with an optionnal blending region where both FCP (or KFC)
*       and KUO scheme are in use.  
*       The weights are "1." and flags are "2" where only FCP (or KFC)
*       scheme is requested.
*       The weights are "0." and flags are "0" where only KUOSYM
*       scheme is requested.
*       The weights correspond to a weighting factor to FCP (or KFC)
*       scheme's contribution with respect to KUO's contribution.
*       The flag "-2" indicates a blending region where both schemes
*       are requested.  
*       The weights vary linearly in the blending region.
