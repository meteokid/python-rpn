*note
*     For an interpolation point x such that x1 < x2 < x < x3 < x4 then
*     frdel = x - x2, frhh = x3 - x2, frhm = x2 - x1, frhp = x4 - x3 and
*     the interpolation using f2 = f(x2), f3 = f(x3) and s2 = s(x2), s3 = s(x3)
*     the function and the second derivative/difference values at x2 and x3
*     respectively is written as
*
*     f(x) = ( 1.0 - frc0 ) * f2 + frc0 * f3 + frc1 * s2 + frc2 * s3
